# Getting And Cleaning Data Course Project

This repo contains the code and data for the final project of the course - **Getting and Cleaning Data**.

The data was downloaded from this [link](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) and extracted into the folder **UCI HAR Dataset**.

The script **run_analysis.R** needs the data folder **UCI HAR Dataset** to be present in the same folder it is in. The script also needs the tidyverse package installed.
